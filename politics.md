As a company, we don't restrict conversations about politics. We have employees and contractors who are all over the political spectrum, and we respect that.

The folks here aren't one-dimensional; we all live in a social, economic, and political context. We have feelings, families, histories.

"Business" exists within these contexts. If ideas about business are divorced from their human context, how helpful are they really?

Business is profoundly affected by the outside world. Politics, natural disasters (and our response to them), economies, societal beliefs, injustice: all of these things affect markets.
So as "business people," we care about things not related purely to business.

We need leaders, bloggers, podcasters, founders, and creators who bring their whole selves to their craft and their community.
We are not one-dimensional figures. :v:

Please note, “bringing our whole selves” to the conversation doesn’t give us license to be:

- rude
- careless
- offensive
- obnoxious
- inconsiderate
- discriminatory

It’s the opposite! We have to be more considerate, more kind, more thoughtful. :heart:
