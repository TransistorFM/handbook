## What are our values?

_In our effort to find meaning and purpsose in our work, we want to identify values that edify us, people in our communities (online and local), and our planet._

* We value the open internet, and specifically decentralized, open protocols (RSS, email, the web).
* We value mindful technology. Audio is slower, more mindful, and easier to turn off. We don't want to optimize for people being addicted.
* We value our planet. There's only one earth, and technology companies are currently contributing to climate change. We want to mitigate our effects on the planet, and leave it better than we found it.
* We value openness, honesty, and vulnerability. We don't hide from bringing up difficult topics. Hard conversations now means an easier life in the long-term.
* Our emotional and physical welllbeing is priority #1. It's worth investing money and time to take care of ourselves.
* We support other indie makers, creators, organizations whenever possible. 
* Simplicity over complexity. Slow and mindful instead of "move fast and break stuff."

## Questions to ask when making decisions:

1. Does this decision match up with our values?
2. Is this decision going to make our life more busy, more complicated?
3. Is this decision going to make the company heavier, slower?
4. In 6-12 months, will this decision cause us to feel less excited about building Transistor?
