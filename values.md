## What are our values?

_To find meaning and purpose in our work, we want to identify values that edify us, people in our communities (online and local), and our planet._

* Simplicity over complexity. Slow and mindful instead of "move fast and break stuff." Small instead of large.
* Our emotional and physical wellbeing is our number 1 priority. It's worth investing money and time to take care of ourselves.
* We value openness, honesty, and vulnerability. We don't hide from bringing up difficult topics. Hard conversations now will translate to an easier life in the long term.
* We value the open internet, specifically decentralized protocols (RSS, email, the web).
* We value mindful technology. Audio is slower, more mindful, and easier to turn off. We don't want to optimize for people being addicted.
* We value our planet. There's only one earth, and technology companies contribute to climate change. We want to mitigate our effects on the planet and leave it better than we found it.
* We support other indie makers, creators, and organizations whenever possible.

## What are our beliefs?

* Good businesses have margin. Profit margin? Yes. But also margin for our time, our emotional and physical health, our relationships, our sanity, and our integrity. We are human, and humans need breathing room.

## Questions to ask when making decisions:

1. Does this decision match up with our values?
2. Is this decision going to make our life more busy, more complicated?
3. Is this decision going to make the company heavier, slower?
4. In 6-12 months, will this decision cause us to feel less excited about building Transistor?
