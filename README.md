# Transistor.fm Employee Handbook

Transistor is a new company, but we wanted to start clarifying **who we are**, **what we do**, and **why we do it** now. Undoubtedly, this document will change as we evolve. That's OK. In sailing you set your rudder; this determines your direction. In the same way, we want this to be a place where we start to define our work culture and our history.
